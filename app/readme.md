SKITGUBBE

Preparations: 
• 52 cards, no jokers. 
• Aces are highest, threes are lowest. 
• Players are dealt 3 cards each, placed face down without revealing their identities. 
• Then, 3 cards are dealt to each player, placed face up on top of the hidden cards. 
• Each player is given 3 cards to play with in their hand, not visible to the other players. 
• The rest of the deck is placed face down.

Game: • The player with the lowest card or the three of hearts begins the game. 
• Players take turns clockwise, and must play a card of the same or higher value than the one played before. 
• After playing a card, a player picks up one from the hidden deck, ensuring that each player always has at least three cards to play with. 
• If unable to play a card of equal or higher value than the last one, regardless of suit, the player must pick up all the cards in the pile. 
• If a player has multiple cards of the same value, they can play them simultaneously. 
• When there are no cards left to pick up from the pile, players start picking from the three visible cards first and then the three hidden ones. 
• The last player with cards remaining at the end loses and becomes the "Skitgubbe".

Special rules apply: • Twos trump all cards, and anything can be played after them. • Tens or four-of-a-kinds clear the pile, and those cards are no longer in play
